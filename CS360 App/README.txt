Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

  The app I designed was a weight tracking app. The app allowed users to input their body weight on a certain date. It also alerts the user if their bodyweight drops below their goal.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

  The screens necassary for my app were a register page, a login page, an add new weight page, and a database display page.The functions necassary were to let the user login, register, enter weight. The UI was made to be intuitive for users.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

  I approach designing applications by laying all of my cards out on the table and designing structures one by one based on how the application is supposed to be made. It all depends on the overall outcome of what I want the application to be, but depending on what is is, truly shapes the design method used. I prefer use a tree base design pattern, where I start with a trunk (Base application) and build up all of my features throughout the tree it self and all of the branches and leaves it can have. I plan applications for longevity and to be fully modular. I also approach development in the same context.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  I test the code by developing personal test cases. I then try every possible way to break the app after all my test cases pass. I realized that my test cases were not all encompasing as things broke in ways I did not expect them to.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

  I had to innovate and change the way I took the date from the user. I made it where the user had to input a button on a calendar to avoid the wrong data being inputed. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  I think my knowledge of databases was showcased well in this project. I may still lack in UI but I am able to create and manage databases very well.

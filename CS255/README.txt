Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  The DriverPass system is a system that will teach young drivers how drive and pass the DMV Drivers Test. It will give them the opportunity to take tests and get driving experience. 

What did you do particularly well?

  In this class I did well encompassing the whole of the project in the UML Diagrams. I also did a good job with creating bussiness plans and the scheduling of the work. Such as a Gantt chart. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I had to choose one item to revise I would choose my UML Case Diagram. I would choose this because I feel that I fail to encompass every use case that exists. I would add more use cases and make it easier to follow. Currently it seems overwhelmed with arrows going everywhere. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I thought about user's needs by reading the desired effect of the business owner. I then used personal experience of when I took drivers ed, thinking of what I wish I had the opportunity of. It is important to think of a project from the user perspective because in the end they are who will be using the system. It is also important for self-preservation becuase it users do not enjoy the system the business owner will not be happy. If the owner is not happy they will blame the product which will impact your ability to code. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I approach designing software by thinking of what the baseline product is, and then I envision what would be nice additional features. Once I hsve the entire software planned out I implement the lowest levels of functionality and build on top. I think of it like a pyramid, building the base and each additional function on top of it on the way up. This is similar to an AGILE approach of constantly delivering working code that is iterative.

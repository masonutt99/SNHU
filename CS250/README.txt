How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  Creating user stories helps me see from the perspective of the end user. Knowing what is expected helps me grasp the idea of what the project should do.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  I approach developing programs by building working code. I like to build it like a pyramid. Building a base and building on top of that base. This is an agile concept of constent delivery of working code. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  A good team member is there to help and encourage other team members. They also take the extra time to comment on code and use industry standard practices so that their code can be used again.
